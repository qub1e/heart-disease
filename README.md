# heart-disease
Analysis of the dataset about habits and the medical characteristics of the person, I predicted does he have heart disease or no

As my previous project(house price prediction), I did the same things, but after data preprocessing, I choose the best technique to deal with imbalanced data using imblearn library. According to the purpose of the project, I used 3 ML of unsupervised learning(clustering) â€“ decision tree, random forest and KNN and I did grid search to use the best hyperparameters for ML using sklearn library.
